<h3>Week 1: Final Project Proposal</h3>

<p class = "margin"></p>
Here are 3 ideas for my final project
<p class = "margin"></p>

<h4>Idea 1 : [Robot Sword-Fight Game]</h4>
<p class = "margin"></p>

I want to make a small portable arena for the robots to fight in. I want them to move easily and quickly (I'm thinking of a berring on the bottom maybe magnetically attached?)
I would like to have weapons that can swap out and a head that pops off in combat. A player loses when their robot gets its head popped off.

<h4>Idea 2: [Compactable + automatic nightstand with cool leds on the bottom]</h4>
<p class = "margin"></p>

I want to make a nightstand that can roll with a remote control, compress to small easy to put away size, and adjust height.
It will have LED's around it that will be easy to change and dim with the remote control. It will look blocky and the blocks will shift out and over each other.

<h4>Idea 3: [small glass companion robot]</h4>
<p class = "margin"></p>

I want to make a little robot guy that walks around small drinking glasses, steps in them, and keeps them glasses organized and evenly spaced
It would be able to detect small glasses, the edge of the shelf, and books or larger glasses or whatever. It would be cute and silly and ideally quiet and efficient.
I want it to run for a long time without needing to be charged too frequently.
